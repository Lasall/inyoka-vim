inyoka-vim
==========
inyoka-vim contains an [inyoka](http://inyokaproject.org) VIM syntax
highlighting scheme (and in short some snipMate sippets) for VIM 7+.
I have choosen colors which are imho good readable with a dark colorscheme
(I use xoria256) but please feel free to propose changes (e.g. a complete
suite for a light colorscheme). Also inner file syntax highlighting of other
common languages is supported (c, cpp, sh/bash, python, perl, xml). Adding
other languages is very easy. Just look into the code line ~90.

I got inspiration from the markdown syntax scheme by Tim Pope.
